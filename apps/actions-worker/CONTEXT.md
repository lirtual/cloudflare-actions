# Unified Cloudflare Actions — bounded context (Spec #21)

The `cloudflare-actions` Worker is the single **physical runtime** for the
static reviewed Action Catalog: `weixin.send_text`, `weixin.notify_download`
and `bark.send_notification`.
A logical Provider/Handler is not a separately deployed Worker. All business
orchestration, Published Plans, immutable Action grants, durable dispatch
reservations and cancellation remain in `lirtual/mcp-workers` Workflow.

## Domain vocabulary

- **Action ID**: stable logical name of a reviewed operation, not a URL or
  executable plugin identifier
- **Action Contract**: immutable schema and handler identity digest; source
  and Workflow consumer must independently agree on the digest
- **Worker Version ID**: actual Cloudflare deployment identity shared by all
  Actions; changing any Handler changes this identity
- **Historical Receipt**: original read-only Weixin D1 evidence keyed by the
  original Invocation and generation; never authorizes another send
- **Migration Gate**: Workflow D1 single-row fence that is checked inside the
  same atomic INSERT that claims an external-send entitlement

The original Weixin D1, historical receipts, Access-protected Owner page
and Bark AES-256-GCM sender are reused. Under the 2026-10-30 Owner decision,
the old encrypted binding is explicitly unbound after a safe dispatch freeze;
a fresh key requires one new verified Owner QR pairing. No
runtime plugin loading, cross-Action credential selection, generic HTTP
executor, new storage, or public send endpoint is permitted.

**Status (2026-10-31):** the unified Worker, protected producer/consumer
releases, domain transfer, fresh Owner QR/proof pairing, source receipt
preservation and both Weixin/Bark single-shot physical handset E2E are
verified. Six original business Workflows remain paused pending exact-grant
republish and deliberate resume; legacy Worker/publisher retirement is not
performed. Prior source-only preflight history is retained in
`docs/spec-21-cutover.md`.
